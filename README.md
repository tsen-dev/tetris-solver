## Overview
Given a sequence of tetrominos, this program will compute and display the columns and rotations at which the tetrominos should be dropped into a grid such that the height of the resulting stack is minimised.
 - The maximum allowed length for a tetromino sequence is determined by the MAX_SEQUENCE_SIZE macro in tetromino.c
